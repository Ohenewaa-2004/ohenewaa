      <h2>How it started</h2>
      I started my freeCode Camp Journey on October 7,2024.
    It was enjoyable and fun in the beginning as I was learning something new. However, as time went the reality of
    the work hit me... It wasn't just something I was just  to do for fun but I had to learn, retain and reproduce.
    I successfully completed the first module,"Responsive web" on November 15,2024.</p><br>

      <h2>What was required of me</h2>
      I was required to host at least one of my projects on the freeCode camp as proof that I actually did what was
    required of me. I used a free hosting website called "tiiny" for that and my work was really really live.
    Boy!, you should see my excitement when that worked.</p>

      <h2>We did it!</h2>
      We don't talk enough about how much work we put in to the work and how much we get frustrated even though we
    try to get it right. "Your code doesn't work", "Try again" are just someof the things that get the frustration in 
    when sometimes all we missed was a simple semicolon or hyphen or we forgot to space before and after a comma.
    Then when we finally get it right, we read, "You are good!" and "Pickachu chooses you!" The excitment that 
    comes with reading that.</p><br>
